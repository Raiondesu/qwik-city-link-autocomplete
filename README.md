# Qwik City `<Link href>` autocomplete extension

Visual Studio Code extension that provides autocomplete for the `<Link>`'s `href` attribute value based on the `src/routes` directory structure.

## Features

- Automatically provides autocomplete when placing the attribute quotes (`"` or `'`) or a url slash (`/`).
- Caches suggestions and reacts to directory changes.
- Detects the attribute's value borders and replaces it with the chosen suggestion regardless of current cursor position.
